# Create an User Account

Creating an user account will give you access to: 

- Create and manage your projects
- Set your providers, agents and numbers
- Manage your user settings

> If you already have a Fonoster account, you're all set here! [Log in](https://console.fonoster.io) and feel free to jump to the next step.

You will need to [Sign In](https://console.fonoster.io) with GitHub to create a Fonoster account

This will give you access to our main console where you can start adding numbers, providers, SIP agents, domains and so much more! 

But before we can get started we need to **create a New Project** that will automatically generate us our `ACCESS_KEY_ID` and our `ACCESS_KEY_SECRET` needed to make calls from Node.js.

**Create a new project**

And give it a friendly name, we will call it Demo

Now you have access to our **Dashboard** where you can see your new `ACCESS_KEY_ID` and your `ACCESS_KEY_SECRET` and many other features on your left side of the screen

**Your Account Credentials** are different from those in your Project and you can find them by going into your account

And this is how you account credentials look like. They will have the `US` prefix (i.e: `US618572e3ec11d10600000001`)

Now **you are all set with the basics of your Fonoster account for the next step** and start making calls from Node.js or just play around with our Dashboard making your first **Hello World.**!
