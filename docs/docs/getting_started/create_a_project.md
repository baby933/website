# Create a Project

Projects in Fonoster allow you to manage related resources in a single place. With your Project account, you will be able to create and manage your Providers, Numbers, SIP Agents, Domains, Functions, etc.

Each Project has its own `ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `ACCESS_KEY_SECRET` and are prefixed with `PJ` (i.e: `PJ619154d081467a0700000001`)

To create a new Project with the console, you can issue the `fonoster projects:create` command and answer the prompts.

Then, to manage your resources you use the `fonoster projects:use [REF]`, which will make your Project the default.

You are all set. You can now begin adding your Providers, Numbers, etc.
