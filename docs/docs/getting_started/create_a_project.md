# Create a Project

Projects in Fonoster allow you to manage related resources in a single place. With your Project account, you will be able to create and manage your Providers, Numbers, SIP Agents, Domains, Functions, etc.

Each Project has its own `ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `ACCESS_KEY_SECRET` and have the `PJ` prefix (i.e: `PJ619154d081467a0700000001`)

```none
1. Open a new terminal
2. Type the command "fonoster projects:create"
