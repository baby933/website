# Install and setup the CLI

Fonoster's command-line tool will help you manage your Fonoster instances. From creating `Agents` to deploying `Functions` and more.

## Installing

The command-line tool is available via NPM. You can install the command with:

```bash
npm -g install @fonoster/ctl
```

## Commands and subcommands

The command-line tool comes with built-in commands covering all main use-cases and additional commands via plugins. Most commands are "collapsed" under a section. For example, the `agents` sections contain the following commands:

- `agents:create`  creates a new agent resource
- `agents:delete`  removes agent from a project
- `agents:get`     get information about an existing agent
- `agents:list`    list registered agents
- `agents:update`  updates a agent at the SIP Proxy subsystem

## Authenticating the CLI

To authenticate the CLI, you need to issue the `fonoster auth:login` command. You can point the CLI to your own Fonoster instance, or use our [as a service](https://console.fonoster.io) option.

## Command view

This is how the command line looks like:

```
