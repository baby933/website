# Feedback

We want to provide you with the best possible experience. To do that, we need your valuable feedback. Because we know you are busy, we provide two ways to get quick feedback from you. From the command line, use the `fonoster bug` command to start a GitHub issue. Or, you can use the `fonoster feedback` command to complete a short survey (which takes less than 30 seconds).
