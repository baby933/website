## Specs for Dialogflow backend

To allow for seamless integration between Dialogflow and Rox, we introduced the concept of Effects. Effects are actions sent from Dialogflow to Rox so you don't have to programm the behavior everytime. All you need to do is send the Effect's payload and Rox will react accordingly.

> You can send multiple responses from Dialogflow. The Effects will run in sequence.

<table>
<tr>
<td> Effect ID </td> <td> Description </td> <td> Payload Example </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 

`say` 

</td>
<td> The Effect will randomly pick a textual response and play it back to the user </td>
<td>
  
```json
{
  "effect": "say",
  "parameters": {
    "responses": [
      "Goodbye!",
      "Talk later",
      "Bye!",
      "Have a good one!"
    ]
  }
}
```

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 

`hangup` 

</td>
<td> The hangup Effect will close the call </td>
<td>

```json
{
  "effect": "hangup"
}
```

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 

`send_data` 

</td>
<td> Use this Effect send arbitrary data to the client. Note that this only works with clients that subscribe for events</td>
<td>

```json
{
  "effect": "send_data",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "map",
    "icon": "https://freeicons.net/icons/map.png",
    "link": "https://goo.gl/maps/YTum2VeZSQwNB4ik6"
  }
}
```

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 

`transfer` 

</td>
<td> Forward call to a different endpoint </td>
<td>

```json
{
  "effect": "transfer",
  "parameters": {
    "destination": "17853178070",
    "record": true
  }
}
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

> Notes: The parameter `type` is set to map in the example, but you can send anything that makes send to the client. If the parameter `allRequiredParamsPresent` is set to true, the fulfillmentText will be take presedence over the custom effects.

## Environment Variables

Environment variables are used in the entry point script to render configuration templates. You can specify the values of these variables during `docker run`, `docker-compose up`, or in Kubernetes manifests in the `env` array.

- `INTENTS_ENGINE` - Use to select the intents engine. Accepts `[dialogflow.es, dialogflow.cx]`. **Required**
- `INTENTS_ENGINE_AGENT` - Intents Agent identifier.  **Required for `dialogflow.cx`**
- `INTENTS_ENGINE_LOCATION` - Region where the bot was deployed.  **Required for `dialogflow.cx`**
- `ASR_ENGINE` - Use to select the ASR engine. Accepts `[google]`. **Required**
- `TTS_ENGINE` - Use to select the TTS engine. Accepts `[google]`. **Required**
- `TTS_VOICE` - Name of the voice. Check https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/voices for a list of Google TTS voices. **Required**
- `INITIAL_DTMF` - Set if you want to send a DTMF at the begining of the call
- `WELCOME_INTENT_TRIGGER` - Set if you want to ask the backend for a welcome intent
- `ACTIVATION_INTENT` - Set to the desired intent if you want to have an activation command. If this is set, the `INTERACTION_TIMEOUT` will have not effects
- `INTERACTION_TIMEOUT` - Timeout, in seconds, to ask again for user input. Use `-1` for no timeout. Defaults to `-1`
- `EVENTS_ENABLED` - If set to `true` it will send events to ws clients subscribed to events. Defaults to `false`
- `ACTIVATION_TIMEOUT` - Time in seconds for the duration of the `AWAKE_ACTIVE` state, set for the activation command. After this time the bot will return to `AWAKE_PASSIVE` and new intents will be ignored. Defaults to `15000`
- `LANGUAGE_CODE` - Sets the default language for the application. Defaults to `en-US`

## Exposed Ports

- `3000` - Port to start a session request
- `3001` - Port to subscribe for `send_data` effects

## Volumes

- `/etc/rox/google.json` - This must exist if `INTENTS_ENGINE=dialogflow`, or `ASR_ENGINE=google`, or `TTS_ENGINE=google`

## TODO

- Add authentication to secure the events port
